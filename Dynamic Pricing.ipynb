In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F<sub>1</sub> score.

    "Based on the results, I most definitely believe that a random forest model will be most appropriate for this task. When 100% of the training data is used, The F score for Random forest is higher (0.794) compared to other models (Decision trees - 0.716 and Gaussian Naive Bayes - 0.75). Based on these factors, random forest is better suited to make predictions. It performs fairly well and the training time and prediction times are on acceptable levels.\n"

    "In order to understand how Random Forest works, we need to understand how a Decision Tree Classifier works.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree Classifier basically asks a series of Yes or No Questions, and based on the responses, it arrives at the final decision/result/outcome. It's basically like playing a game of 20 questions. Assuming that in this game the task is to predict what person/object are you thinking about, I start to ask a series of Yes/No type questions. Now, if the first question that I ask is - \"are you thinking of a potato\", that would be pretty much useless. Instead, if the question that I ask is \"Is it a person\", then that reveals much more information. This way, every question that I ask would be about maximizing the \"Information Gain\", each successfully bringing me closer and closer to the final prediction. The Decision Tree works exactly this way, using the features in the data-set to form its series of Yes/No questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is prone to making mistakes, or overfitting. A random forest works by collecting the results of multiple decision tree classifiers and averaging their results. The majority vote of the collection of decision trees is considered to be the final prediciton."
